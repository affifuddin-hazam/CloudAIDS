# Introduction
Cloud and Intrusion Detection System or known as Cloud AIDS is a program that i made for my friend's final year project. This program is written in VB.NET and it is powered by [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) as it's detection engine. It's UI is inspired by my favourite antivirus software, [ESET](https://www.eset.com/my/home/).
